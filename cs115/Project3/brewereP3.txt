TEST CASES

Menu prompt...

Enter two letter postal code...
FL

Florida has 27 electoral votes...
Who won Florida?...
1

Menu prompt...

Obama - 27
McCain - 0
Undecided - 511


#The basics of the program seem to work fine.
  The undecided category should be fool-proof
  because it's calculated from the candidates'
  values. The scoreboard and menu display well, 
  too.


Menu prompt...

Enter two letter postal code...
asdf

State not found. Try again...


#Check. I used a boolean instead of your -1
  trick to check if the state was valid just 
  because it seems a little clearer to me.
  No segmentation fault like the guy who was
  sitting next to me.

Obama - 0
McCain - 27
Undecided - 511


#I think this function should be fool-proof
  because it first sets both candidates' values
  to 0 and adds the constant inside the
  electoral votes array to the state winner's array. 
  The undecided value is always recalculated.

Invalid input.


#I tossed in error messages to catch invalid input
  in the menu, the state search, and the "who won?"
  I also have error messages to catch input that is 
  valid, but happens to be out of the scope of the 
  program. ie. 88 given to the menu input. I used the
  same generic message regardless of the type of
  invalidity.



:::
Obama has won!


#If either candidate does have 270 votes, this is 
  announced at the end of each loop iteration. 
  The code is entirely straight forward. 
  Similarly, if there is a tie, this is announced
  in the same place. I'm sure these condition
  statements can never overlap.

Enter two letter postal code...
Who won Arizona?...


#This isn't too much of a problem; it's just
  that the program first grabs the integer and
  then takes the first recognizable string and
  uses it for the state search (even though they're
  not separated by white space). I wouldn't even
  consider it a flaw even though one might consider
  this invalid input for the menu screen.

Ok, try again later.
