Lab5

  The executable lab5a outputs totals that are a considerable
amount less than the outputs from lab5b. This is because a MAX
value was used in lab5a - it was set to 100. The array could only
hold 100 elements. The words read into lab5b are stored in a
vector. The vector doesn't have a defined maxmimum number of elements.
The push_back function continues to add space to the vector. It can 
hold a very large number of elements, but I couldn't tell you exactly
how many.
