1. To what programming paradigm family does the language Prolog belong?
  Prolog belongs to the logic programming paradigm family.

2. For what types of applications is Prolog an appropriate programming language?
  Theorem proving, artificial intelligence,

3. Describe each of the following terms with respect to the Prolog programming language:
a. world
  The collection of all rules and facts within a program.
b. fact
  Looks like     cat(Tom).
  Read as "Tom is a cat."
c. rule
  Looks like     Head :- Body.
  Read as "Head is true is body is true."
d. base
  
e. predicates
  Equivalence of a C method.
f. arguments
  Same as C arguments. These are passed as parameters to predicates.
g. arity
  The mumber of arguments of a predicate.
h. list
  An ordered collection of items. Denoted by brackets [].
i. instantiation
  "Setting up" variables and constants for use of the internals.
j. unification
  The process of deducing a string of predicates for truth.

4. Describe the Prolog syntax rules regarding each of the following:
a. selecting variable names
  Starting with an uppercase letter, consisting of letters, numbers, or the underscore.
b. defining constant (literal) values
  Must start with a lowercase letter.
c. use of periods (.)
  Statement terminator.
d. use of semicolons (;)
  
e. use of commas (,)
  Statement separator.
f. formulation of facts
  Such as     mother_child( trude, sally ).
              father_child( tom, sally ).
g. formulation of queries
  Such as     ?- father_child( tom, henry ).
              No.
h. formulation of rules
  Such as     parent_child( X, Y ) :- father_child( X, Y ).
i. assignment statements
  
j. conditional expressions


5. How do you create a Prolog source file? How do you document a Prolog source file? How
     do you load the file using the Prolog interpreter?
  Emacs or your favorite text editor - .pl extension.
  
  $ gprolog on cwolf, then > ['filename'].
