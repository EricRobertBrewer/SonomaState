Notes:
- Assumes perfect input from the user. --No error recovery.
- Command lines must end on a non-space character. 
- No redirect functionality whatsoever.

- I had an ongoing problem regarding calling execvp.
  I first counted the number of arguments in a given single command; 
  not a piped command. I copied the command strings to variables of type 
  char*. I then set the following char* in the array of char*s to NULL.
  The next command, if it was longer than the previous command, will 
  segmentation fault when strcpy() is called on line 108 because it is 
  trying to access the elements specified by a NULL pointer. The 
  mirrored structure, char*** null_backup, tries to remedy this on line
  183, butdoesn't work correctly. --Only the first command of the session 
  is guaranteed to work.

- Other than this, piping works fine - without redirection.
